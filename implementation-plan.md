## Immediate Next Actions (This Week)

### Priority 1: Update Your Backend

1. **Replace models.py** with enhanced version
2. **Replace api.py** with comprehensive endpoint implementation  
3. **Add ml_predictor.py** for risk assessment
4. **Create init_db.py** for database initialization
5. **Test all API endpoints** with Postman/curl

### Priority 2: Set Up Development Environment

1. **Install additional dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install flask-cors flask-migrate scikit-learn pandas numpy joblib
   ```

2. **Create project structure**:
   ```bash
   mkdir logs tests static templates
   ```

3. **Initialize enhanced database**:
   ```bash
   python init_db.py
   ```

4. **Test enhanced API**:
   ```bash
   python api.py
   # Test with curl commands
   ```

### Priority 3: Mobile App Planning

1. **Choose development platform** (Native vs React Native vs Flutter)
2. **Set up development environment** 
3. **Design basic UI/UX wireframes**
4. **Plan beacon procurement** (recommend 10-20 for pilot)

## Weekly Milestones

**Week 1**: Enhanced backend operational with all APIs working
**Week 2**: Mobile app prototype with basic BLE scanning  
**Week 3**: Full contact tracing and risk assessment functional
**Week 4**: Dashboard and alert system integrated
**Week 5**: Production deployment and pilot testing

## Technical Decisions Needed

### 1. Mobile App Technology Stack
- **Native** (Java/Kotlin + Swift): Best BLE performance, platform-specific optimization
- **React Native**: Faster development, shared codebase, good BLE support
- **Flutter**: Modern UI, single codebase, decent BLE plugins

### 2. Beacon Hardware Selection  
- **Estimote Beacons**: Premium, excellent SDK, $30-50 each
- **Kontakt.io**: Healthcare-focused, good range, $25-40 each  
- **Generic iBeacon**: Cost-effective, basic functionality, $5-15 each

### 3. Deployment Infrastructure
- **Cloud**: AWS/Azure/GCP for scalability and reliability
- **On-premise**: Hospital data center for data sovereignty
- **Hybrid**: Local processing with cloud backup and analytics

### 4. Database Choice for Production
- **PostgreSQL**: Recommended for complex queries and scalability
- **MySQL**: Good performance, widespread hospital IT familiarity  
- **MongoDB**: Flexible schema, good for real-time data

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- **Backend Developer**: Python/Flask expertise (you!)
- **Mobile Developer**: iOS/Android BLE experience
- **Frontend Developer**: React/Vue.js for dashboard
- **DevOps Engineer**: Deployment and infrastructure (optional for pilot)

### Hardware Requirements  
- **Development**: Your current setup is sufficient
- **Production Server**: 16GB RAM, 4 CPU cores, 500GB storage
- **BLE Beacons**: 50-100 units for full hospital coverage
- **Mobile Devices**: Staff smartphones (Android 5.0+ or iOS 10.0+)

### Budget Estimation
- **Beacons**: $1,500 - $5,000 (50-100 beacons)
- **Server Infrastructure**: $200-500/month (cloud hosting)
- **Development Tools**: $100-300/month (various services)
- **Mobile App Development**: 2-4 weeks of development time

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **BLE Interference**: Plan for beacon placement testing and optimization
- **Battery Drain**: Implement efficient scanning algorithms and background processing
